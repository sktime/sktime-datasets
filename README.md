# sktime-datasets

GitHub LFS repository of datasets loadable from the ``sktime`` package.

Currently used as mirror of primary dataset repositories to prevent downtime and notification periods for any change to ``sktime`` users.

Currently not directly contributable, and contains no code (this may change in the future)
